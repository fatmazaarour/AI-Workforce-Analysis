# AI-Workforce-Analysis
Data Analysis of AI Impact on Jobs (2010-2025) using Python and SQL
# Global AI Impact on Jobs (2010–2025) Analysis

## Project Overview
As a Data Professional with a PhD in Finance, I am investigating the "Workforce Revolution" caused by AI adoption. This project analyzes a decade of global data to identify which sectors are most affected by automation and where new opportunities are emerging.

##  Tech Stack
 **Python**: Data Cleaning & Trend Analysis (Pandas, NumPy)
 **SQL**: Structural Data Querying
**Power BI**: Interactive Data Storytelling
**Statistical Modeling**: Correlation analysis between AI adoption and job displacement.

## Key Research Questions
* Which industries experienced the highest job displacement due to AI?
* Is there a measurable correlation between "AI Adoption Rate" and "New Job Creation"?
* What are the projected workforce trends leading into 2030?

##  Repository Structure
* data: Original and cleaned datasets.
* notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks with Python code.
* dashboards: Power BI file (.pbix) and screenshots.
